1. Ingest core files => new list of names of core stuff, including additional core scripts

2. Scan ingest and target dirs to determine 4 lists: new docs, changed docs, deleted docs,
   the resulting full list of docs

3. Generate the docs from the "new" list (with their local files). Generate them using the full list from (2).

4. Generate the docs from the "changed" list, after copying their local files and noting their versions,
   as well as the existing versions of other local files. After creating each new doc, old versions of local
   files are deleted

5. Delete the docs from the "to delete" list
